== Introduction

Phusion Passenger probably requires no introduction. Please take a look at 
http://www.modrails.com/ for general information.

== Building the package

You need a debian box with all debhelper utilities to build the package:

  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

== Legal

Phusion Passenger is a trademark of Hongli Lai & Ninh Bui. Thanks also to 
Neil Wilson (http://github.com/NeilW/deb-passenger), John Leach (http://github.com/johnl/deb-passenger) 
and Brightbox for the hard work.
